<h4 class="mb-2">Hi :wave:</h4>

<h1 class="mb-2">I'm an always learning Web Developer currently located in sunny Edmonton, Canada.</h1>

<p class="mb-2">I'm always looking to improve my skillset and expand my areas of knowledge in the development world. Often that means that I am working with new and exciting technologies! In the past year I have achieved a beginner to intermediate level understanding of working with Docker in both local development, and on production environments, and in my own personal time I have made efforts to learn more modern backend languages such as golang (<a href="//github.com/bAngerman/advent-of-code-golang" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Advent of Code using golang</a>.</p>

<p class="mb-2">While the interests I have described focus more on a backend oriented individual, I am confident in front end systems, whether it be JavaScript frameworks or creating a style system using <a href="//css-tricks.com/bem-101/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BEM</a> ideologies.</p>

<p class="mb-2">In my personal time you can find me going for walks with my dog, or driving, or running.</p>
